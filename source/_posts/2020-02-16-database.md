# Topic Introduction

First of all, this topic contains notes for cs307 database. It records my roads to learn the database and the difficulties I face with their resolutions. The goals of this topic are: 1. A review material for myself 2. An augmented learning experiment by trying to speak out what I learn(or so called teach others, which I don't deserve that). 3. Help others, mainly my friends, to learn database lessons.

If you have any problems while reading through these notes, please feel free to contact me via my QQ: 820585042. I'm glad to have discussion with others.
