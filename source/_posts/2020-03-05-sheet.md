# Basic concepts

## Unit Conversion

1 word = 32 bits= 2\*half word(2 \* 16 bits)=r\*byte(4 \* 8 bits)

## Data Storage

Instructions are all 32 bits(1 word)

A character requires 1 byte of storage

Registers are 32 bits

# Data

name:	storage_type	value(s)(Separate by comma)

## Data types

| storage_type | description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| .word        | Occupy a word(32 bits) place                                 |
| .byte        | Occupy a byte(4 bits) place                                  |
| .space       | Followed with a number indicates the amount, similar to array declaration |
| .ascii(z)    | Declare a string, z indicates if there's a '\0' follow       |
|              |                                                              |
